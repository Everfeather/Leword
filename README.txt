Welcome to Leword!! My custom wordle solving bot, 
along with a playable version of wordle that works more than once a day.


Leword has a very limited vocabulary, they understand things like:

next (go to next guess)

ins [guess colors] (insert results of guess)

contains [word] (see if Leword still has this word in their word list)

validate [word] (see for yourself if a word is valid in Lewords eyes)

stop (for when you're done)

to run:

extract all .py & .txt files to the same folder.
run leword.py
(optional) run wordle.py

to update Leword example:

ins gyngy

means first letter is green, second is yellow, third is gray, fourth is green, fifth is yellow.

when you guess a word in the wordle game it will give you this string to copy paste into Leword

have fun (: and play around with the calc_word_score function, see if you can make it better
